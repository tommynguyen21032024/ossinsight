In this chapter, through clicking and scrolling up or down the options below to choose the right metric, the ranking place, and the time period, you can create your own custom insights into **programming languages repos** on GitHub since 2011. 

Note: 
1. Move your cursor onto any of the repository bars on the chart to get the exact number. 
2. The SQL commands above each chart are what we use on our TiDB Cloud to generate analytical results. Try those SQL commands by yourselves on TiDB Cloud with this [10-minute tutorial](/blog/try-it-yourself/).
