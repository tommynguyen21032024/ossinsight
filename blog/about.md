### Who we are

PingCAP started in 2015 when three seasoned infrastructure engineers were sick and tired of the way databases were managed, scaled, and maintained while working at leading Internet companies.

Seeing no good solution on the market, they decided to build one themselves — the open-source way.

With the help of a first-class team, and hundreds of contributors from around the globe, PingCAP is building an open-source distributed NewSQL Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. TiDB, our flagship project, is a cloud-native distributed SQL layer with MySQL compatibility, and one of the most popular open-source database projects in the world (don’t take our word for it, check it out). TiDB’s sister project, TiKV, is a cloud-native distributed Key-Value store. It is now a CNCF Graduated project.
