### Who we are?

> PingCAP started in 2015 when three seasoned infrastructure engineers were sick and tired of the way databases were managed, scaled, and maintained while working at leading Internet companies.
> 
> Seeing no good solution on the market, they decided to build one themselves — the open-source way.
> 
> With the help of a first-class team, and hundreds of contributors from around the globe, PingCAP is building an open-source distributed NewSQL Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. TiDB, our flagship project, is a cloud-native distributed SQL layer with MySQL compatibility, and one of the most popular open-source database projects in the world (don’t take our word for it, check it out). TiDB’s sister project, TiKV, is a cloud-native distributed Key-Value store. It is now a CNCF Graduated project.
