In this chapter, we will share with you some of the **top Web Framework repos on GitHub in the past one, two, five, and ten years respectively** measured by five metrics: the number of stars, forks, PRs, contributors submitting the most PRs, and contributors merging the most PRs.
Note:
1. Click and scroll up or down to choose the right metrics, years, and rankings of web framework repos you want to learn about.
2. Move your cursor onto any of the repository bars on the chart and get the exact number.
3. The SQL commands below each chart are what we use on our TiDB Cloud to get the analytical results. Try those SQL commands by yourselves on TiDB Cloud with [this 10-minute tutorial](https://ossinsight.io/_/more/analyze-github-events-on-tidb-cloud-in-10-minutes).
